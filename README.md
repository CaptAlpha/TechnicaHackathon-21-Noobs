## Overview of the project

>A platform where all schools, colleges and universities can host their online class meetings and exams and students can easily attend classes and exams in low network connections._

|Challenges to manage|: Online Exam Process|
|---------------------|:---------|
|What we want to solve|Main|
|Internet connectivity is still a huge problem in case of low network connection. In the case of a concurrent number of exams, internet connectivity can be a huge challenge for the smooth flow and execution of the online classes and exams.
|We are trying to make a platform where student can attend their classes and exams at both low and high internet connectivity and does not face a problem in uploading the image of answer during exam.
|

## Significance of the Project
* Operatable in low connection network
* Assignments and answers can be uploaded in low network
* User Friendly User Interface
* No more connection loss during classes, exams, uploading assignment
* It will provide students one discrete destination for all the problems they face in day to day online classes.

* Managing time is one of the most tedious work we face on a daily basis. The user friendly interface will allow students to access through the web application very efficiently

## Objectives we want to achieve

* Access to education is a right  not a privilege. We are presenting a web application which ensures that  low internet connectivity will not render in the path of learnin
* Students can enter chat rooms to interact with teachers and get their doubts solved even in low internet connectivity
* Examination process wont cause stress and anxiety anymore. Students can very easily surf through the examination process (like uploading answer scripts ) very smoothly .


## Project Timeline

*Phase 01*  :
We started the out with our problem statement and then created an idea . Decided on all the features the web application will have . Ranging from classrooms to exam facilites in low speed internet connectivity

*Phase 02*   :Created a work breakdown structure(WBS),starting from our scope statement and then breaking our deliverables into smaller pieces.(Work Packages) . Divided  each work package into tasks.

*Phase 03*   :Determining project dependencies . Creating a flowchart or diagram. Determining total time needed for each task


*Phase 04*   :Identifying resource availability for the project .
Different softwares and tools required .
Setting milestones

*Phase 05*   :Integratting all the work packages and finalizing it .
